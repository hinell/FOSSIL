## Overview
The FOSSIL License is forward-compatible with (i.e. upgradable to) many open-sources licenses like [GNU GPLv3]/ [GPLv2][GNU GPLv2] and was heavily inspired by [BSD 3.0] license. Unlike GPL, it does NOT require you to provide a source-code to a consumer of your final software product. On the other side, however, it requries you to ship and show the license.

If you are earing money by using FOSSIL-licensed software you are advised to negotiate amount of fees with copyright holders and actually pay them in a reasonable time. You bear all the consequences of a failure doing otherwise.

## History of creation and Motivation
<!--TODO:finish-->
> _<small>«The reason why men enter into society is the preservation of their property;» - John Locke</small>_

Since 1976 software industry, both closed- and open-source, is challenged by keeping their work profitable and their life sustainable. The most common one challenge is the copyright infringement, also known as _piracy_.

A _corporate piracy_ is an specific case of software piracy which represents an act of using others inviduals' works with intention of selling it as part of other work without due permission given from such, or worse - a lack of the requirement of thereof. The both may be often aggravated by a refusal by a corporation to share profits made in cases when permission can be obtained and profits shared at decent prices.

This license addresses this very issue: it requries one to explicitly either to share profits made from work or lose all permissions granted by it entirely.


Many big corporations realizing idea of free workforce piggying back on open-source community
unrewarding environment that flurished

profitable  cases when their products were used by big corps

unrewarding environment which lead to numerious cases of protests 

As a 2020 Coronavirus pandemic was dragging on and ravaging the economy it became increasingly harder for communities and companies to thrive.

This license was made with a goal to takle the issue.

### Cases to learn from
* **TJ hylowaychuk**, [Delete my code! (mochajs)](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/4467)
* [Core-js], @Zloirock: started a [widely despised] advertised of unemployment on the NPM registry; because of this NPM introduced new support field in the `package.json` files; paid $5000
* [Faker.js] , @Marak [Case (January 2022)]
* [log4j] - a logger for Java. There, [Open source maintainers are effectively unpaid outsourcing teams for giant corporations.][1], by Yawar Amin ([twitter Post][0]) (January 2022);
* [Jest] testing framework case - a good case with a limited corp support (allegedly).
